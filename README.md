#Qura'an Kerim
-----------------------------------------
For All languages the package polyglossia supports
-----------------------------------------
The note is a bit obsolete but for anyone who want to compile the Quraan in another language and Arabic...
Look at the file eyquranABM.tex (arabeyes.ttf font and their language font name)
--------------
--for Amharic|
--------------
 I made from old LaTeX sources (fonts made 1996 or back)
 the font EthiopABM.ttf (those fonts were not in ttf format)
**Rule 1:**
Surah 1 is du'aa shouldn't/cannot be put/compiled *without* Surah 2. The two make the main body.
Then you can proceed further.
(xe)Latex install: windows (http://miktex.org) linux (http://latex.org)

**To produce one surah alone use before sections \setcounter{secnumdepth}{surahnumber}**
#TODO: border art using tikz<br/>

The main LaTeX package used here (You can see myquran00.tex for reference) is polyglossia.
Using the eyquranABM.tex (or myquran00.tex) one can modify the document to output into a different language setup-list of lang.s on page 4 in the [Polyglossia Manual](http://planethio.com/polyglossia.pdf).
#To output pdfs:  
1. Install the font arabeyes.ttf or mequran.ttf  INCLUDED here. In addition for Amharic users find abyssinicaSIL on sil website or google search for it on the web or alternative fonts; <br/> 
2. Make sure you select the font of choice as in- main.tex (or myquran00/2.tex);<br/>
3. Run <it>xelatex eyquranabm.tex </it> (or myquran02.tex) shell/command promp (or using ghostview-windows) 

##OBJECTIVE
This is so that people can have their own offline use and is to decrease the use of Internet and its related current problems. One can write a facebook comment but cannot help themselves write a single aya on computer that they can later use . HUMANS ARE NOT KHALIDIN. They wear/end/last.

A word for this Ramadan Kerim(1443-14 Ramadan, 1443)- "altheena atedew fi sabati qulna kunu qiradetan khassieen" -
 those (jews and christians) who trangressed against the Sabat we said to them (cursed them)"be apes and accursed filth".
the except of exceptions --and a bit of joke
----------------------------------
I have to start from myself and my high school life in 7th day adventist church boarding school (from 1998-2001). My german educated old mentor (who claimed to have translated the book -"the great contoversy" by Ellen G. White of which she was one of the founders of 7th day advetist church-into Amharic.) (they claim she was deaf and blind). This personal go between person with my Swiss sponsors/the mentor attached his support to me being/converting to 7th day adventist follower which I did because it was no big problem. 
Eric Raymond-Unix Programmer and Philosopher- has one rule of programming he calls "the except of exceptions" as there is no god but God. Keeping the story short the 7th day adventist was a noise of Sabat(the 7th day)...
--this is where we come to the conclusion "one should not disturb people talking about rest(or Sabat,the 7th day)"...
--they are disturbing about the 7th day..
as Qura'an says "those who transgressed against the Sabat..."
Then after there is another big burden...why did Abssiynia changed its name to what looks like "a disturbance about rest" e-sabat or (ethiopia)...that the rythmical origin of the word ethiopia is e-Sabat (no-Sabat e-no)...why do Abysinnian Esiobiats are living like monkeys and apes...and live in low and filthy status)
--case 2:they are led astray to "disturbing about rest" or the Sabat.
Conclusion:-I am Abyssinian but not Sabat disturber (or E-Sabat e-thiopian). Muslims in reign of Haile Selassie the 1st were called "people who live in Ethiopia" but not Ethiopians.
Have they known Allah or do they have assurance from Allah that they do not get punished(get the wages for the deeds of their fathers and theirs). Many errors and evil knots done by fathers of a generation that has been done cannot be corrected/untied because as the Qura'an says the people always say we are in this because our fathers were in it (could be religion).

Ramadan Kerim!!!!
